# JobTread On-Screen Takeoff via API — Protocol & Run Log

How to perform plan takeoffs **directly inside JobTread's Plans tab** (calibration, drawn
measurements, and takeoff **parameters**) through the Pave API — no UI clicking. Every
convention below was **empirically verified** on live org data (first on Job 2025-227,
655 115th Ave, Treasure Island). Follow the playbook; append learnings to the Run Log at
the bottom each time this runs. Companion helpers: `estimating/scripts/jobtread_takeoff.py`.

## 1. The verified data model (the crown jewels)

| Fact | Value | How verified |
|---|---|---|
| Annotation coordinate space | **Native PDF points (72/in), page-local**; `meta` annotation `{width,height,rotation}` mirrors the PDF MediaBox | Org plan stored meta 792×612 = exactly its letter-size page |
| `plan.scale` semantics | **PDF points per real METER** (calibration) | Every org value decodes as a standard imperial scale (below); UI displayed my computed values exactly |
| Scale for imperial drawings | `scale = inches_per_foot × 3.28084 × 72` → **¼″=1′-0″ → 59.05511811; ⅛″ → 29.5275591; 3/16″ → 44.2913386; ½″ → 118.1102362; ⅜″ → 88.5826772; 1″ → 236.2204724** | All recurring org values matched; 40′-0″ printed dim measured exactly 720 pt on a true-scale ¼″ sheet |
| Values are **recomputed from geometry** | The `value` you send is advisory; JobTread recomputes from annotations × scale | Sent 96.22 LF hand-sum; read back 96.825 (app measured the polyline, including a 10.7-pt jog) |
| `isNegative` subtraction | Closed path with `isNegative: true` inside a measurement subtracts exactly | GF net area read back = interior − patio − core to full precision |
| **Full-replace semantics** | `updateJob.parameters` and `updatePlan.annotations` REPLACE the whole array | Read-backs always mirror exactly what was last sent |
| Where geometry belongs | **Parameter measurements embed their own annotations** (+ `planId`, `color`); `plan.annotations` = free markup only (meta + notes). Don't duplicate shapes in both — they'd render twice | UI-created takeoff (632 Boca Ciega) + our own saves |
| Parameter types | `area, linear, count, linearArea(depth), areaVolume(depth), linearVolume(width+depth), areaPitch, linearPitch(pitchX/Y), linearDrop(startDrop/endDrop), formula(name+formula), number, option` | Schema introspection `parameters` type |
| Path structure | `path.points` = array of `{annotationId}` refs to sibling `point` annotations; `isClosed` for areas; for a **perimeter as linear**, use an open path with N+1 points (repeat the first coordinate as a new point id) | Org example + our saves |
| Text annotations | Require non-null `fontWeight`, `fontStyle`, `fillColor`, `fillOpacity`, `rotation` (API errors one missing field at a time) | updatePlan error `A non-null value is required … fontWeight` |
| Mutation returns | `updatePlan`/`updateJob` return **root** — select a root field (e.g. re-query the job) or the call fails validation | `The field "id" does not exist at "updatePlan"` |
| Permissions quirk | Grant may block root `plan{}` (`readPlan`) while **`job → plans` works** (`readJobPlans`) | Live 403 on root query; job-path succeeded |

## 2. API access pattern (Pave)

```jsonc
// org + job
{"currentGrant": {"organization": {"id": {}, "name": {}}}}
{"organization": {"$": {"id": ORG}, "jobs": {"$": {"where": ["name","like","%2025-227%"]}, "nodes": {"id": {}, "name": {}}}}}
// plans on a job (page-per-record; file.url is the CDN link)
{"job": {"$": {"id": JOB}, "plans": {"nodes": {"id": {}, "name": {}, "page": {}, "scale": {}, "annotations": {}, "file": {"name": {}, "url": {}}}}}}
// write calibration + markup (FULL REPLACE of annotations)
{"updatePlan": {"$": {"id": PLAN, "scale": 59.05511811023622, "annotations": [...]}, "job": {"$": {"id": JOB}, "plans": {...}}}}
// write parameters (FULL REPLACE of the whole array — read-merge-write!)
{"updateJob": {"$": {"id": JOB, "parameters": [...]}, "job": {"$": {"id": JOB}, "parameters": {}}}}
```

Schema discovery when anything is unclear: `{"schema": {"$": {"path": "root", "search": "<kw>"}}}`,
expand with `{"schema": {"$": {"path": "root.updatePlan.$.annotations._on_path", "expand": true}}}`,
global types by name (`parameters`, `plan`).

## 3. Getting the plan file (sandbox reality)

- `cdn.jobtread.com` is typically **blocked by the environment egress allowlist** — the API
  rides the MCP connector, file downloads don't. Fix permanently: add `cdn.jobtread.com` to
  the environment's network settings.
- Workaround: pull the **identical file from Google Drive** (teams store the same PDFs).
  Match by exact filename. Drive MCP downloads ≳8 MB may fail ("session expired") — prefer
  the smaller per-discipline files.
- Verify you have the SAME file the Plans tab shows (name + page count + page size).

## 4. The takeoff playbook (per plan page)

1. **Identify the sheet & true scale.** `pdfinfo` page size; find a printed overall dimension
   and measure it in the **vector** line work (PyMuPDF `get_drawings()`): e.g. 40′-0″ must be
   720.0 pt on a true ¼″ sheet (18 pt/ft). If it isn't, the sheet is plotted off-scale —
   calibrate `scale` from the measured pt-per-ft × 3.28084 instead of the nominal table.
   *UI equivalent (user-taught):* Plans tab → **Manual Scale (Select Points)** — click the two
   endpoints of a printed dimension line and type its length; JobTread computes the same
   pt/m scale. Use it for quick per-sheet calibration by hand, or to verify an API-written
   scale against a known dimension in seconds.
2. **Extract, don't squint.** `get_text("words")` for room labels, dimension strings, tag
   counts (e.g. counting "SMART VENT" labels gave the exact flood-vent count); `get_drawings()`
   for wall lines (long H/V segments, parallel face pairs ~wall-thickness apart), diagonals,
   filled poche. **Door/size tags (32X84 etc.) are often outlined text that does NOT extract**
   — read them from ≥200-DPI crops; never conclude "absent" from the text layer.
3. **Close the dimension chains.** Partial dims must sum to the overall (e.g. 10′-8″ + 30′-2″ +
   18′-10″ + 1′-7″ + 3′-5″ = 64′-8″ exactly). Chain boundaries give interior wall positions in
   points: `pt = face + Σ(dims × 18)` on ¼″ sheets. A chain that closes is your license to
   trust the derived positions.
4. **Two-source every count** (takeoff-accuracy-protocol §1): openings from **elevations**
   cross-checked against **plan symbols/swings/tags**; vents from label counts vs a second
   sheet's schedule (CSBA816 ×8); areas vs the printed area tabulations.
5. **Compose parameters programmatically** (use `jobtread_takeoff.py` builders) — unique
   annotation ids across the entire array; rectangles as 4 points + closed path; perimeters
   as 5-point open loops; subtractions as `isNegative` closed paths **inside the same
   measurement**; count parameters as styled point markers at the real locations.
6. **OVERLAY-VERIFY BEFORE SAVING.** Render the page, draw your exact geometry on it, and
   READ the image. This step caught every real error (see Run Log). Fix, re-render, then save.
7. **Save = read-merge-write + read-back.** Read current `job.parameters`, merge (preserve
   everything you're not changing — full-replace semantics!), send, then read back and diff
   names/values. The read-back is the "save confirmation".
8. **Report with the overlay image** so the human can compare against the JobTread UI in
   seconds, and state every ± tolerance in the parameter/measurement **names** (they are the
   only field the UI always shows).

## 5. Naming & style conventions (keep the Parameters panel readable)

- Prefix by level/scope: `GF …`, `FF …`, `SF …`, `Roof …`.
- Put the honest flag in the name: `(gross)`, `(net)`, `(recessed)`, `(±1)`, `(± verify)`.
- Measurement names carry the derivation: `"209.33 LF x 13'-0" floor-to-floor — gross,
  deduct openings/vents at estimate"`.
- One color per parameter family (footprint red #cf1620, perimeter orange #e8871e, areas
  teal/green, core goldenrod #b8860b, partitions purple #6a1b9a, windows blue #1565c0,
  doors #c2185b/#5d4037, vents violet #7b2ff2).
- Update the plan's single `text` markup note to summarize the parameter set (with "safe to
  delete"), keep `meta` + note as the ONLY plan.annotations.

## 6. Known failure modes → guards (each one happened)

| # | Failure | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Trusted a calc/text-derived layout → massive undercount | Plan graphics govern; vector extraction; closure checks |
| 2 | Mixed wall FACES when tracing a polyline (length ≈ right, placement zigzagged) | Follow ONE face; overlay-verify; let JobTread recompute length |
| 3 | Misread a **recessed** balcony as cantilevered | Dim-chain arithmetic decides (1′-7″+3′-5″ = 5′-0″ inside); recessed areas subtract from conditioned |
| 4 | Elevator/stair boxes off by a bay in congested cores | Overlay-verify at high DPI; label `(± verify)` if unresolved |
| 5 | Concluded openings "absent" because tags didn't text-extract | Outlined text: crop at 200+ DPI and read; elevations as second source |
| 6 | `updateJob.parameters` wiped prior params | Read-merge-write ALWAYS; read-back diff |
| 7 | Mutation selection invalid (returns root) | Select a root field (re-query job) in the same call |
| 8 | Text annotation rejected (`fontWeight` non-null) | Send the full text field set (§1) |
| 9 | CDN download blocked / Drive big-file failures | §3 fallbacks; ask user to allowlist cdn.jobtread.com |
| 10 | Hand-summed values ≠ app-computed | Expected — geometry is truth; values are advisory (state this to the user) |

## 7. What good looks like (reference result)

Job 2025-227, one A1.0 sheet (GF+FF at ¼″): **27 parameters** — footprint/plate 2,586.67 SF
each; perimeter 209.33 LF (walls 2,721.3 / 2,512.0 SF @ 13′/12′); patio 360.9; balconies
196.7 + 143.3 (recessed); nets 1,943.6 / 2,156.3 via isNegative; cores 144.4 / 120.5;
partitions 96.8 / 130.0 LF; vents ×8; full openings schedule (2 OH + entry + 2 sliders +
5 GF windows + 3 GF interior; 5 balcony doors + 7 FF window units + 9 FF interior doors) —
all geometry-anchored, cross-floor reconciled (both floors sum to the same 2,448.9 SF
interior; cores and patio/balcony walls stack at identical coordinates).

## 8. Next capabilities (not yet built — pick up here)

- **Cost items wired to parameters** (`createCostItem` + quantity formulas referencing
  parameter names) — the estimate then updates when a measurement changes.
- Per-room breakdowns; `areaVolume` for slabs (depth-verified), `linearArea` for wall
  areas by height zone. (GF+FF+SF+Roof passes complete — see Run Log.)
- Batch calibration of every plan page in a job (scale table §1 makes this mechanical).
- Elevations-page markers (bind the same parameter to multiple planIds — one measurement
  per plan page).

## 9. RUN LOG (append one entry per run — this is the improvement loop)

### 2026-07-04 (2) — Job 2025-227 — SF + Roof (A2.0, 04.10 A0.0 set) — Claude
- **Off-scale plot detected & calibrated (§4.1 guard validated):** the A2.0 sheet plotted at
  **94.4%** of nominal ¼″ — apparent 40′ spans measured 680 pt, not 720. Solved
  **k = 17.00 pt/ft** by least-squares on consecutive dimension-text center spacings
  (6 estimates within ±0.03), → `scale = 17.0 × 3.28084 = 55.77427821522309` pt/m.
  Verified against 40′-0″ (680.0 pt) and 64′-8″ (1,099.2 pt) printed overalls exactly.
  **Never assume the §1 nominal table — measure a known dim first, every sheet.**
- **Plans queries paginate:** a size-25 default hid existing page records → created a
  duplicate plan for page 4 (deleted via `deletePlan`). Query `plans` with `size:40`+ and
  check for the page BEFORE `createPlan` — the whole file is usually already imported.
- **Elevations killed 5 phantom windows:** first pass placed 12 SF window markers; the
  four elevations + 300-DPI wall strips proved 7 openings (2 W, 3 E, ribbon S, 1 in SE
  balcony back wall) — the north-face "windows" were the balcony door-M assemblies' own
  glazing. Two-source rule (§4.4) is the difference between 12 and 7.
- **Congested-core guard paid again:** roof bulkhead first drawn as a rectangle (202 SF);
  300-DPI zoom showed a **T-shape incl. the door-J vestibule** → 8-pt polygon, 221.7 SF,
  reconciling the printed tab's 220. Multi-point polygons work fine as `isNegative` too
  (bulkhead subtracted from covered zone as an 8-pt negative path).
- **API nit:** `area`-type parameters REQUIRE non-null `unit` ("foot") — count types don't.
  Error surfaces as `A non-null value is required at ...parameters.N.unit`.
- **Cross-checks vs printed roof tabulation:** open 1,606 (tab 1,650), covered-net 650
  (tab 723 — different zone splits; tab's open+covered+bulkhead sums to the gross deck),
  bulkhead 221.7 (tab 220 ✓). Differences stated in measurement names.
- **Version-mismatch RFI raised:** SF/Roof measured on the 04.10 A0.0 set; GF/FF basis is
  the 06.25 A0.1 permit set — confirm no A2.0 revision between sets.
- **State after run: 44 parameters** on the job (10 GF + 9 FF + 8 openings + 10 SF + 7 Roof),
  both plan pages calibrated, one note per page. Full-replace merge preserved all 27.

### 2026-07-04 — Job 2025-227 (655 115th Ave, Treasure Island) — GF+FF+openings — Claude
- **Discovered/verified:** everything in §1 (first run; coordinate space, scale=pt/m,
  recompute-from-geometry, isNegative, full-replace).
- **Caught by overlay-verify:** foyer diagonal face-mixing; recessed front balcony;
  elevator box 11′ off. Zero errors reached JobTread uncorrected except the foyer
  polyline (fixed in the next save; app-recomputed value exposed the jog).
- **User-confirmed in UI:** 2,586.67 SF / 40′ / 4 displayed exactly as computed.
- **Process changes adopted:** compose param JSON programmatically (unique-id check);
  values advisory; ± tolerances into names; one text note per plan.
- **Open for next run:** cost-item wiring; SF/roof pass; cdn.jobtread.com allowlist
  request pending; door/window schedule still absent from design set (± on counts).
